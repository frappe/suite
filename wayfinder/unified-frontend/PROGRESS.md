# Unified frontend: implementation ledger

The orchestrator session updates this file after each unit lands. The plan
is [`unified-frontend-plan.md`](unified-frontend-plan.md).

## Run rules (Faris, 2026-09-29)

- Scope: stages 0 to 6 and 8 to 12, Drive issues 39, 41 to 45 and 47, and
  Suite asks S1 to S4. Then a local rehearsal of both flip states. The run
  stops before stage 7.
- Stage 0 merge needs no approval pause.
- No push during the run. Every merge is local to `forge/drive-layer`.
- Opus agents on medium effort implement. Codex `gpt-5.6-sol` reviews,
  researches and gives second opinions.
- Error tracking (Sentry) is out of this run.
- Site lock: every `run-tests`, `migrate`, `bench execute` and browser
  journey on `slides.localhost` runs under `flock /tmp/suite-uf-site.lock`.

## Open questions for Faris

1. **Cmd+K palette (stage 0).** Upstream #848 added a Cmd+K palette to the
   shell and palette entries in the Mail, Calendar and Meet sidebars.
   Ticket 012 says launch has no palette. Production already has it,
   because production tracks `develop`. Interim: the run keeps upstream's
   palette and builds nothing new on it.

## Old bugs found, assigned to a unit

| Bug | Found in | Assigned to |
|---|---|---|
| `shell/MobileNav.vue` passes `:to`; frappe-ui item takes `route`, so phone nav items do nothing | stage 0 | stage 1 |
| Capability journeys assume Administrator has no mail account; the site has `administrator@suite.test` since 2026-09-18 | stage 0 | stage 1 (shell journeys), stage 5 |
| `FilePreviewSurface.vue` passes `:link`; Button takes `href`, so Download does nothing | stage 0 | stage 11 (Drive sub-lane) |
| Writer surface throws on `storage.styleClipboard` | stage 0 | stage 11 (Writer) |
| `test_shims` permanent-surface check fails on `api.product.set_settings` | stage 0 | Drive 39 |
| Logout no longer calls `clearSlidesUserData` (merge regression) | stage 0 | stage 0 |
| Upstream `SuiteCommandPalette.vue` calls legacy `suite.drive.api.*` for search | stage 0 review | stage 11 (legacy-call baseline) |
| `suite/calendar/http/routes.py` types `recurrence_rule` as a string, route returns an object; Home Upcoming errors for any account with events | stage 0 | stage 5 (Calendar sub-lane) |

## Baselines

Stage 0, `06d5c0225`, 2026-09-29. Gates run by the orchestrator after the
review fixes.

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `yarn test:unified` | 31 files, 103 tests pass |
| `yarn test:legacy` | 2870 tests; matches the manifest (0 expected failures). One timing-sensitive Meet test (`ParticipantConnection lifecycle`) failed once under load, then passed |
| `yarn check:import-boundaries` | 376 owned graph violations, 71 unstable frappe-ui imports baselined |
| `yarn check:bundle-budget` | 146.62 KiB gzip, 28 chunks (cap 200) |
| `yarn typecheck` | 0 errors in scope (128 at start); 1111 outside scope ignored |
| Architecture test | 7 tests OK |
| Journeys (agent run) | shell 12 of 16, files 58 of 63 (2 fixme), home 9 of 10. Failures also fail on the pre-merge commit |
| Backend (agent run) | `test_http` 4, `test_contract` 2, `suite.api.test_routes` 9, `test_account` 10, drive `test_routes` 102: all OK. `test_shims` 266 of 267 (`set_settings`, pre-existing) |

Site data on `slides.localhost`:

- 2026-09-29: three empty "Untitled Sheet" rows from 2026-09-23 (Sheets
  `42lu282cdd`, `5p1q8onbjh`, `7058epn4nm`) had legacy `File` rows and no
  Drive node, so `after_migrate` refused. The orchestrator backed them up
  to `~/backups/slides-localhost/orphan-sheets-20260929.json` and deleted
  them. `migrate --skip-fixtures` then completed.
- Four documents have nodes whose `name` field differs from the document
  (Writer `qpbhfljtgt`, `u69iadktp2`; Presentation `u6cck0hr73`; Sheet
  `u6ae4ocqai`). A full Drive Build rerun would stop on them. Migrate does
  not. Left alone.
- The dev site bench (`suite-bench.service`, 8006) runs without reload.
  It serves pre-merge Python until someone restarts it. The run does not
  restart services.
